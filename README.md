## Installation
Install via Unity Package as you would with any other package. Make sure the script sits in the "Assets/Editor/" folder.
Alternatively, drop the source file directly into said folder.

## Usage
- Under "Tools/Find All UnityEvent References" open the editor window.
- Click the button in the window to scan the project for buttons referencing method calls.
- Once all method references are loaded, they will show up in a list below the editor button together with a total reference count
- Expand a method to view the exact references and whether they are coming from Scene Objects or Prefabs
- Use the search bar found at the top of the window to filter the results
